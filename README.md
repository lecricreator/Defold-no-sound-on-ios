no sound on ios, but on IPad

It's a project which allows to prepare the build.

It allows to debug the game to see why there is no sound on ios, but on IPad.

I have a basic idea of the problem, it's possible that below ios 15.0 doesn't work, unfortunately I can't debug after 3 weeks on it (I don't like Apple :(((( ).

Thank you for what will.
